Hi, I'm Varsha 👋  

I enjoy turning ideas into working software — from backend-heavy web applications to clean, user-facing interfaces.
Currently, I’m a B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering student at Shiv Nadar University, Chennai, focused on building practical systems and strengthening core CS fundamentals.

I work primarily with full-stack technologies and spend a lot of time solving algorithmic problems in C++, which helps me write efficient and scalable code.  
Alongside this, I’m actively building my skills in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**, with a focus on applying them to real-world problems.
